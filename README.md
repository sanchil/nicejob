# NiceJob

NiceJob is a simple nodejs db package for accessing records in 
google firestore data base


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites and setting up your environment

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

#### create firestore account

Create google project on console.cloud.com

#### create a firestore db
Create a firestore db and manually add a few small records. For sake of demo. 
This project adds following three fields
  
  
{
first_name:,
  
  
last_name:,
  
  
email:,
}

#### install gcloud
This is optional but one may install the gcloud sdk on local environment to set up service accounts and access credentials for your project

#### create a serviceaccount and a key file

following are the gcloud commands that you need to execute to get a service account and credentials.

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create <serviceaaccount_name>
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <projectid> --member="serviceAccount:<serviceaaccount_name>@<project_id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role="roles/owner"
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create <key_file_name>.json --iam-account=<serviceaaccount_name>@<project_id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com

```
For retrieving the key file do an ls and a cat on the key file and copy it and save it locally

```bash
ls -l
cat key_file_name>.json
```


## Installation via Docker file.

Run the db package and companion package via a docker file.

Download the docker file and presuming that docker environment has been set up locally.

```bash
docker build -t sanchil/nicejob .

docker run --name nodeapp -dp 4000:3000 \
  -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<key_file_name>.json \
  -e USERS=<collection> \
  -e NODE_ENV=prod \
  sanchil/nicejob
```
#### to stop the application  
```bash
docker stop nodeapp
```

#### force stop and remove the application  
```bash
docker rm -f nodeapp
```

Access the application on http://localhost:4000.
