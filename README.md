# NiceJob

NiceJob is a simple nodejs db package for accessing and writing records into a google firestore data base instance. Google Firestore is a nosql database for building web and mobile applications. It is excellent for holding large amounts of small records and files.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment section for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites and setting up your environment

Artifacts you need to install the software and how to install them

### 1. firestore account on google
      
### 2. vm on google

### 3. nodejs platform
  * Test Environement: JEST
  * Code Transpiler: Babel
  * Node monitor: nodemon
### 4. ExpressJS
      Platform application server            
### 5. docker latest
      
### 6. redis latest
    To handle server side cacheing.
### 7. vs code/vim or just any editor you like
    With all the necessary plugins to handle various types of files such as yaml, javacript, Dockerfiles etc

#### create firestore account

Create google project on console.cloud.com

#### create a firestore db
Create a firestore db and manually add a few small records. For sake of demo. 
This project adds following three fields
  
  
{
first_name:,
  
  
last_name:,
  
  
email:,
}

#### install gcloud
This is optional but one may install the gcloud sdk on local environment to set up service accounts and access credentials for your project

#### create a serviceaccount and a key file

following are the gcloud commands that you need to execute to get a service account and credentials.

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create <serviceaaccount_name>
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <projectid> --member="serviceAccount:<serviceaaccount_name>@<project_id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role="roles/owner"
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create <key_file_name>.json --iam-account=<serviceaaccount_name>@<project_id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com

```
For retrieving the key file do an ls and a cat on the key file and copy it and save it locally

```bash
ls -l
cat key_file_name>.json
```

## Installation 

### Artifacts

There are three artifacts in this package:

1. fireStoreAPI
   An api package to write, read one and read many records  
   
2. nicejob
   This is the companion application using the fireStoreAPI package to make calls to the Firestore DB instance.   
   
3. Dockerfiles
  1. Dockerfile # To build the nicejob companion package
  2. Dockerfile.redis   # To build the redis image for server side caching of responses.
  
### Environment

You will need to following environment variables are available at all times for the functioning of the application and setup.
The best way is to provide them via a .env file located in your application root folder. However, they may also be provided via a command line to invoke the process or providing them to your shell environment.

#### ENV variables

**GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS:** <the path to the service account json file for your firestore database>  
      
**COLLECTION:** <The name of the collection/collections you intend to use in your app. Currently it may be ignored>

**NODE_ENV:**   <dev/prod>

**KEY:**        <Google project API_KEY. If you intend to use REST/gRPC to make calls to firestore db then an API KEY is preferebale. Currently it may be ignored>

**PROJID:**     <Google Project ID>

**NICEAPP_CACHE_MAX_AGE:**  <Set up server cache parameters/ 3600>

**NICEAPP_CACHE_ALLOCATED_MEM:**  <Set up memory allocated to cache/64>

**REDIS_PORT:** <Assign a port value to your redis cache/6379>

**REDIS_HOST:** <Host IP/location of the the server/localhost or a docker id or a physical id>
  
These values need to be provided separately to JEST test environment via **setJestEnvVars.js** file

#### Security Keys

You will need the security file provided by Google cloud in a json file format. Please make it available to the application in /<approot>/src/keys/<security_key>.json. The manual and docker builds will eventually it available to the application from this location.

API_KEY value provided by google for firestore project may also be noted. 
 
### via Docker files.

Run the following commands on local docker environment. nicejob runs on port 3000 in the container. redis runs on 6379 inside the containers,
Map these to free ports available on docker host.

#### Create a dedicated network redis-net, for nodeapp and redis to run on. 

```bash
docker network create --driver bridge redis-net
```
#### Pull image for redis cache for the ExpressJS server.

```bash
docker pull sanchil/cache:1.0
```

#### Pull image for nodeapp the companion application.

```bash
docker pull sanchil/nicejob:1.3
```

**Note**  

Create the network first, then deploy the cache and finally the expressjs application nodeapp.


#### Start redis cache.

```bash
docker run --name redis -dp 6379:6379 --network redis-net sanchil/cache:1.0
```

#### Start nodeapp application.

```bash
docker run --name nodeapp -dp 3000:3000 \
  --network redis-net \
  -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=nicejob_key.json \
  -e USERS=Users \
  -e NODE_ENV=prod \
  -e REDIS_HOST=redis \
  -e REDIS_PORT=6379 \
  sanchil/nicejob:1.3
```

**Note**  

fireStoreAPI and nicejob companion application have been merged into a single image named nodeapp. cache is a separate image to handle serverside caching.
Please ensure the host ports are mapped correctly to the container ports of node:3000 and redis:6379


### Alternatively, build local images via Docker files.

You may also build the images locally via the docker files located inside the packages. 

Dockerfiles
1> Dockerfile # for building nicejob companion app and fireStoreAPI db packages
2> Dockerfile.redis # for building a cache for the application server Express JS
Run the db package and companion package via a docker file.

Run the docker build command from the parent folders of nicejob and fireStoreAPI

<root>
      + nicejob/Dockerfile
      + nicejob/Dockerfile.redis
      + fireStoreAPI

from <root> folder run the following two build commands. This is necessary for Dockerfile to build a combined image, but optional for building redis cache.
      commands to run these images are same as above

Create redis-net network first
      
```bash
docker network create --driver bridge redis-net
```
Build redis cache

```bash
docker build -t sanchil/cache:1.0 -f nicejob/Dockerfile.redis .
```
Build nodeapp

```bash
docker build -t sanchil/nicejob:1.3 -f nice/job/Dockerfile .
```

#### to stop the application  
```bash
docker stop nodeapp
```
#### force stop and remove the application  
```bash
docker rm -f nodeapp
```

Access the application on http://localhost:4000.

To do a quick check run the curl commmands listed under the test section.

### Manual Installation and Setup.

#### For building the fireStoreAPI

```bash
mkdir fireStore
cd fireStore
npm init -y
npm i --save @google-cloud/firestore dotenv
```


#### For building the companion application

```bash

npx express-generator --git --no-view nicejob
cd nicejob
npm install
npm i --save @google-cloud/connect-firestore dotenv express-session nanoid redis
npm i --save-dev @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/node @babel/preset-env nodemon jest rimraf
npm i --save ../path_fire_store_api_folder/fireStoreAPI

```

## Usage

To start the application change into nicejob app directory and run the following command. The cleans builds and runs

```bash

npm run start:prod

```

To clean and build separately run the following two commands.

```bash
npm run clean
npm run build
```

To run the tests.

Please appropriate modifications to the __test__/getrecords.test.js file to reflect the correct firestore value. It checks for a first_name of a particular record.

```bash

npm run test

```

## Tests

### The access the services via curl

##### readOne

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type:application/json" http://localhost:3000/:collection/:id 
```

##### readMany

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type:application/json" http://localhost:3000/:collection
```

##### write
To create a record

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" http://localhost:3000/:collection
```

##### update
To update a record

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" http://localhost:3000/:collection/:id
```

## Access

Create an instance template with a random docker image say for eg nginx. This is only to create a dockerized instance.
Do not use sanchil/cache:1.0 or sanchil/nicejob:1.3 as these needed to be bound to the manually created network of redis-net
Google cloud instances and instance template.

Note the ip addresses of the instances.

## Deployment

Once logged into the VM instances pull the docker images as per the instructions above and run them. Test them with curl commands.
